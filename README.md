ravewith.us
========

Project for future rave-related items/news and event sales.

Decided to go with the ravewith.us domain. I figure we could slowly expand to other cities and have it go something like

ravewith.us/tampa (or) tampa.ravewith.us
ravewith.us/miami (or) miami.ravewith.us

I think you get the idea...

I'm going to put up a text file with the API keys, I bought a theme on themeforrest to get us started 
(plus I had unused credits and I was bored).

I'll get Kassie or Diego to help out with images, but if you find any high-resolution images that you think we can use,
feel free to upload them. From there we can tweak the design some and at least get something started.
